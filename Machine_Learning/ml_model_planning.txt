ML model

Use oversampling techniques to tackle the imbalance of data. The imbalance is caused by the 
Spotify dataset of songs being 600,000 tracks but we donâ€™t know which ones were ever on the 
top 100 billboard yet so, we will choose over_sampling methods in anticipation of there being 
an abundance of non-top 100 songs.
- Random Over Sampling
- SMOTE Over Sampling

To determine the number of weeks that a song will remain on the top 100 will be require the 
use of algorithms to predict a numerical value.
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Neural Network
- K-Nearest Neighbors

According to 
https://srnghn.medium.com/machine-learning-trying-to-predict-a-numerical-value-8aafb9ad4d36 
these are the most common ML models for predicting a numerical outcome. So, I feel for the 
purpose of education it will be good to employ all four to see what could be the best outcome.
